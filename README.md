# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the 'mobile flashcards' project for the React Nanodegree program. This [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1021/view) is what is used to test this project against.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* clone this repository and insure you have the latest version of nodeJS installed
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Project Notes

The idea of this project is to study for topics using decks and questions.
Standard error checking is applied to prevent things like blank deck names and blank questions.
Using the same format as I learned from following along with the Udacifitness in class project, there is setup for notifications, datastore with redux and leveraging asyncstorage.
